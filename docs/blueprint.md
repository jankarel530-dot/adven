## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Crimson (#D7263D) for the Advent theme.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2F0F1), almost imperceptibly tinted crimson, to provide contrast to the crimson, without resorting to harsh pure white.
- Accent color: Burgundy (#800020), slightly darker and more subdued to signal focus, and draw attention to CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font, giving an elegant, intellectual and contemporary feel.
- Use thematic icons (e.g., Christmas trees, ornaments) to enrich the Advent calendar's interface.
- Adopt a clean, user-friendly layout displaying Advent windows prominently. Incorporate clear, navigable menus and an intuitive interface for effortless user engagement.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and micro-interactions (e.g., subtle window opening animations) to enhance user experience and engagement.
